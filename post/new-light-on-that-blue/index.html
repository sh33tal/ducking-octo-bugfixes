        <p><em>What follows is my take on <a href="http://heyitsalex.net/what-can-happen-in-a-second/">another</a> prompt from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Things-Journal-Francisco-Writers-Grotto/dp/1452105448">642 Things to Write About</a>. It&rsquo;s pretty personal, borderline personal diary. Yeah.
Since this blog is my miscellaneous bucket and I&rsquo;m the editor, I say it&rsquo;s <strong>in</strong>. Let&rsquo;s ship it. Then, see how it feels.
Do not worry, I&rsquo;m not planning on making regular posts about my feelings, probably.</em></p>

<p><em>So here it is, my take on this prompt:</em></p>

<p><strong><em>What a character holding a blue object is thinking about?</em></strong></p>

<p>There I was, holding a blue pen. I had just lost my train of thought. I wasn&rsquo;t exactly looking at it so much as this was an out of focus blue spot. Not any blue either. It was a blue recalling Québec&rsquo;s national blue. I always felt pretty neutral with that particular hue. I always loved blue but I disliked this particular one, much to my chagrin.</p>

<p>Today though, this blue is reminiscent of what we&rsquo;ve left behind. We always knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to relocate. The nice things about California are indeed <em>nice</em> but it&rsquo;s not so much like we weren&rsquo;t happy with Montréal. This story isn&rsquo;t one of a quest for the promised land.</p>

</p>

<p>Some days, we read about cool things that are happening right here, only here. Those days, I feel very fortunate to be here. Other days, we read about some interesting change happening in Montréal and we feel like we&rsquo;re missing out. This is a very typical case of nostalgia versus novelty.</p>

<p>All of that is relatively minor though, in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>Everything, except one.</p>

<p>I can do with a slower public transit system.
I can deal with a more complex health care system.
I can accept living in a less lively neighbourhood.
I am however having a real hard time not having friends.</p>

<p>What friends I hear you thinking?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that I didn&rsquo;t have many. I had to make sacrifices when it became obvious that, as a parent, I wouldn&rsquo;t have the time to do all I was doing before. Friendship took second place to personal projects and family.</p>

<p>Except that this is oversimplifying. I still had friends. I was seeing some of them almost exclusively at the office but they <em>were</em> my friends.</p>

<p>I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to make new friends. I was anticipating that the English speaking version of me would be struggling to find the words to express nuanced thoughts. It would be more difficult to be <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>I knew it would be a challenge.</p>

<p>Is it harder than I thought it would be? Maybe not. But having anticipated it doesn&rsquo;t make it any easier to deal with, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>

<p>I also very much neglected the difficulty in coordinating talking with friends in Eastern time. We&rsquo;re living in an always connected world after all, aren’t we? It could be easier if I didn&rsquo;t care so much about my work but I <em>do</em>. It&rsquo;s what I came here for and I do love it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no happy revelation here. No words of wisdom. I didn&rsquo;t make a new friend just today that made everything all better.</p>

<p>This is one of those things that will incrementally get better over time. I suppose. I hope.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure friends are forever but you could say that we forever needs friends.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I see this blue pen today and it appears in this newly rediscovered grandiose hue.</p>
