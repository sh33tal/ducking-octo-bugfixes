        I&amp;#39;m really sorry about this. I wanted an image and I thought drawing myself octocat-style would be cool. I guess it could have been if I had done a better job. For the record, I blame the tools. No SketchBook Ink for me next time.
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have one thing I want to say today: I love &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this would just barely be worthy of a tiny tweet (and not even a _good_ one), I&amp;rsquo;m going to stretch this as far as I can to get to a blog post length. Just because I feel like blogging today. Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s just how it&amp;rsquo;s going to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past week was really great. Don&amp;rsquo;t you care to know why? Well, fine, I&amp;rsquo;m telling anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts with me just trying to get some data on the distribution of the data across regions in hbase. I thought it was something we should be looking at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enters &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sentric/hannibal&#34;&gt;Hannibal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few minutes, I had cloned it, built it and had it running against one of our clusters. The visuals are really good and it definitely increases our ability to quickly see where we&amp;rsquo;re at compared to a text output (which can also be done pretty easily with an hbase shell script).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this running instance on our data quickly came the realization that we&amp;rsquo;d use this for real. And, like, &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On closer look, I noticed issues with getting compaction logs. Also, I started thinking of some things we might tweak to make it easier to have this deployed and running internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into the details of the changes involved. The &lt;strong&gt;process&lt;/strong&gt; is really the topic I had in mind when sitting down to write this. Or rather the lack thereof really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you notice? I just lied straight to your face and I knew you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t budge. Actually, there _is_ a process but Github makes it all so easy and fun that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like the drag we so often associate with processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how this lays out: You read about this thing or google your way to it. You need this thing and someone already wrote it. It starts here and then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clone, build, run and use the thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something missing or that could use some improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You feel the urge to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the critical part right there. It&amp;rsquo;s often where things &lt;em&gt;get complicated&lt;/em&gt;. You might need to file a ticket first with steps to reproduce. You might need to sell people of that feature you think _should definitely_ be in the scope of the project. You know, it&amp;rsquo;s complicated™. But Github helps. Let&amp;rsquo;s get on with how this goes with it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You fork it. A one click step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do the work. And it&amp;rsquo;s the most fun part. You&amp;rsquo;re excited because this is something that bugged &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s something _you_ care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Done with the changes? Now it&amp;rsquo;s pull requesta extravaganza! This is when you get to show off the interesting work you&amp;rsquo;ve cared so much about. Also, because it&amp;rsquo;s cool to work with people excited about your project, interesting discussions follow. Meeting new folks. You know, &lt;em&gt;talking_ (or, more accurately, _typing&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just describing one scenario here but let&amp;rsquo;s say everything is right and your changes were merged into the upstream repo. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t this feel &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;? It&amp;rsquo;s almost silly but I just feel like a little boy and I want to show mommy how proud I am of the thing I just did. Even for a one line change. I&amp;rsquo;d like to show the whole world about this thing I just did. Please refrain though. People will run away screaming if you do this too often. And maybe even the first time you do it. So, please, don&amp;rsquo;t!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You just feel like smiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, you can get the same great rewarding feeling from contributing to any open source project even if that&amp;rsquo;s not hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. But the entry barrier is just a little bit higher. It takes more time. Some of that precious and limited energy that you have is spent on the _other_ stuff that, well, isn&amp;rsquo;t as much fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything to make the process so easy it just seems to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; exist is an amazing feat. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; really enables tons of changes (okay, I just made that up but I really think it&amp;rsquo;s a good uneducated guess) by just making a path available from discovering a personal need to getting it done. Github is empowering people to fix it &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;. And we all know how momentum is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I won&amp;rsquo;t shock anyone if I say we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to go back to a world without &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. More than &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetbrains.com/&#34;&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;, Github really brings the _develop with pleasure_ motto to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Github, I love you. Never leave me.&lt;/p&gt;
